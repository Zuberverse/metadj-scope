# Agent Coordination - MetaDJ Scope

> Multi-agent patterns for the Daydream Scope hackathon exploration.

**Platform Notice**: This `AGENTS.md` is optimized for OpenAI Codex via the Codex CLI. Claude Code sessions follow the accompanying `CLAUDE.md`, and Cursor IDE uses `.cursor/rules/` guidance when present; each platform gets the same standards.

## Scope
- Governs work in `3-projects/5-software/metadj-scope/`.

## Relevant Agents
- software (architecture and code quality)
- coder (implementation and fixes)
- ai (AI/ML strategy and integration)
- product (requirements and UX)
- operations (deployment and reliability)

## Relevant Skills
- software-development-coordinator
- api-designer
- ai-integration-auditor
- documentation-generator
- test-generator
- accessibility-validator
- visual-identity-validator
- secure-code-guardian
- performance-optimizer

## Coordination Patterns
- Discovery and scoping: product + software, with documentation-generator support.
- Prototype build: coder + ai, with software oversight.
- Review and QA: secure-code-guardian + performance-optimizer + accessibility-validator.
- Release readiness: operations + software.

## Quality Gates
- `docs/scope.md` and `docs/strategy.md` updated before implementation begins.
- `docs/architecture.md` updated before any major build changes.
- README and CHANGELOG updated for meaningful milestones.
- Security review for any external API, auth, or data storage.
